                        The Kanban components allows you to expand or collapse its columns to save space.
                        The remaining columns extend its width to occupy the hided column space.
                        This feature can be achieved by the following properties:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>AllowToggle:</code> Enables the expand/collapse behavior in Kanban.</li>
                        <li><code>IsExpanded:</code> The property determines whether the column can be collapsed on the page load itself.</li>
                    </ul>"
                }
            }
        };
    }
}
